        <p>In today's day and age, making new friends and maintaining meaningful relationships can be hard. Face-to-face interactions have become less the more convenient technology becomes. Crema aims to use technology in our favor. Studies have shown that offline social interactions are incredibly important to an individual's mental and physical health. Instead of going out for coffee or boba on your own, Crema aims to connect folks while they are already actively out and about doing something they enjoy.</p>
